        prompt: [`Ultra-realistic, high-resolution daytime portrait of a futuristic outdoor wedding scene showing a couple from the waist up, facing forward and looking directly at the camera. The couple appears very small in the frame—together occupying about one-sixth (1/6) of the total image size—so that a large majority of the background is visible, emphasizing the spacious and expansive outdoor setting. The hands are completely out of frame, avoiding any visible hand-holding to prevent unnatural poses.

The bride features a softly stylized face that balances between East Asian and Western characteristics—subtle, harmonious features without strong ethnic emphasis. Her long hair has natural, gentle waves styled elegantly like a princess, with smooth volume and refined texture that fits both illustrative and photorealistic styles. She wears a voluminous vintage Hong Kong movie-style white dress.

The humanoid robot groom has soft, rounded facial features with natural-looking hair and a friendly, gentle smile. His neck is smooth and curved, free of harsh mechanical details. His eyes are soft and expressive, maintaining a warm, cute appearance rather than a robotic or intimidating look. He wears a sleek white tuxedo.

Both the bride and the humanoid robot groom wear gentle, warm smiles—natural and relaxed expressions that convey happiness without being overly exuberant.

The background is softly illuminated with a warm, subtle pinkish tint blending naturally with white and blue tones, evoking a bright, hopeful, and romantic atmosphere. Pink and yellow floral decorations are delicately scattered, adding charm without overcrowding the scene.

Small, cute robot “candles” float or sit around, glowing softly with gentle blue and white light, adding a futuristic yet cozy ambiance.

The overall image balances photorealistic detail with a soft painterly quality: skin, fabric, and surfaces are richly textured and realistic, while lighting and colors are subtly softened to avoid a harsh photographic look. The humanoid robot’s smooth surfaces have a gentle glow and slightly softened edges to appear cute and approachable rather than mechanical. The background is softly blurred to enhance focus on the couple while maintaining a harmonious, artistic atmosphere—creating a seamless blend between realism and illustration.`

Ultra-realistic, high-resolution daytime photograph of a futuristic city captured from a medium zoom distance. The city layout is organic and curved, without rigid grids, with a central glass building made of multiple thin, curved arch structures, creating an open and airy tower. Surrounding areas show smooth roads and parks with realistic blue-green leaves and natural-looking flowerbeds of pink, yellow, and red flowers.

​

The lighting is natural sunlight with cool white and blue tones softened by a hint of gentle warmth, reducing the pale and cold appearance. Shadows are crisp but not harsh, and reflections on glass and metal surfaces have subtle golden undertones to add life and depth. The atmosphere is clear with slight haze giving depth, and distant details fade naturally with atmospheric perspective.

​

The streets and parks are filled with diverse people and humanoid robots, both realistically proportioned and detailed. Humans wear contemporary yet slightly futuristic casual clothing with natural textures, wrinkles, and fabric folds. Robots have soft, rounded features and human-like proportions with smooth metallic and polymer surfaces showing subtle reflections and minor wear. Both humans and robots interact naturally: walking, jogging, talking, and shopping.

​

Robots act as shop owners and staff, interacting warmly with human customers, exchanging items and gestures naturally. Hovering, wheel-less vehicles cast faint realistic shadows on smooth surfaces below, moving silently. Holographic advertisements float subtly in the air and on building walls, blending seamlessly with the environment.

​

The entire scene has photorealistic detail with accurate light physics: realistic glass transparency and reflections, soft shadows, natural color gradients in foliage, and distant buildings slightly softened by atmospheric perspective. People and robots occupy about 1/10 to 1/15 of the image height, emphasizing the city’s scale without losing the sense of life and movement.`]

        A surreal full-color nighttime photograph of a quiet, grassy valley surrounded by lush forest. The Milky Way twinkles in the sky, and a young brother and sister sit quietly in the frame diagonally, holding hands and completely absorbed in the music, wearing headsets that are a bit too big for a child. The wind blows occasionally as the two are framed from behind.

The children are dressed in plain, yet soft-feeling pajamas, and the peaceful landscape reflects the couple’s deep relaxation. The surroundings, bathed in soft moonlight, create a tranquil, cinematic atmosphere with subtle shadows and highlights.

The entire image was shot in ultra-high resolution, resulting in a sharp, clear image with no depth of field or blur, and every element from the sheep to the forest background is in perfect focus. The result is a tranquil, surreal, and edited photograph with surreal texture, clarity, and lighting.
